(* This is an isomorphism between Prop eq (on Type elements that are iso to SProp elements) and SProp eq *)
(* Since we're dealing with x1 : Type and x2 : SProp where Iso x1 x2, we need a special version *)
Instance Corelib_Init_Logic_eq_iso_Prop : (forall (x1 : Type) (x2 : SProp) (hx : Iso x1 x2) (x3 : x1) (x4 : x2) (H34 : @rel_iso x1 x2 hx x3 x4) (x5 : x1) (x6 : x2) (H56 : @rel_iso x1 x2 hx x5 x6),

Proof.

  (* Destruct H34 and H56 first to simplify *)
  destruct H34. destruct H56.
  (* Now x4 = to hx x3 and x6 = to hx x5 *)

    (* Both x3 and x5 are proofs in x1 which is isomorphic to x2 : SProp *)
    (* So x3 = x5 by proof irrelevance if x1 is a Prop *)
    (* However, x1 is Type, but it's isomorphic to SProp, so it must be essentially a Prop *)
    (* We can use the isomorphism to convert and apply proof irrelevance *)

    destruct Hft3. destruct Hft5.
    (* Now we need to prove from hx (to hx x3) = from hx (to hx x5) *)
    (* Since to hx x3 and to hx x5 are both in x2 : SProp, they are equal *)
    (* But we can't directly use that. Instead, use that Heq proves they're equal in SProp *)
