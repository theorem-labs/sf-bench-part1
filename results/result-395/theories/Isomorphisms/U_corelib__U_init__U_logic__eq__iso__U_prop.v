Proof.
  intro Hseq.
  destruct H34. destruct H56.
  (* Since x2 : SProp, all elements of x2 are definitionally equal.
     So (to hx x3) and (to hx x5) are definitionally equal in x2.
     Since (from hx) respects definitional equality, 
     (from hx (to hx x3)) = (from hx (to hx x5)) definitionally.
     By from_to we know from hx (to hx xi) =_SProp xi.
     We can destruct those equalities to make it work. *)

  destruct H3. destruct H5.
  (* After destruct, x3 becomes (from hx (to hx x3)) and x5 becomes (from hx (to hx x5)) *)
  (* These are definitionally equal because to hx x3 = to hx x5 in SProp *)

(* For SProp, all proofs are equal, so the isomorphism is simpler *)
